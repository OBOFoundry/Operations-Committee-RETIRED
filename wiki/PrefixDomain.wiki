#summary HOWTO create a prefix and domain for a new resource

= Introduction =

This page describes how-to register a new prefix with the OBO Foundry and create the corresponding PURL top-domain. To register a prefix or domain:
 # the required namespace must be free
 # the resource must be publicly available
 # there must be a contact person for the resource

Ideally, requesters should also submit links to their project homepage/documentation, as well as a link to a tracker. There are no other requirements with respect to orthogonality for example.


= Details =

 * Add the prefix to the file ontologies.txt

The files lives at [http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/ontologies.txt http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/ontologies.txt]. Note that you will need to have sourceforge access to the OBO project at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/obo/ https://sourceforge.net/projects/obo/]

 * Add the tracker information
In the file [http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/trackers.txt http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/trackers.txt]

 * Create the top-level PURL
Go to [http://purl.org http://purl.org] and register the new domain as a subdomain of /obo/. Once logged in, go to the tab "Domains", option "create a new domain", and create the domain /obo/prefix (where prefix is the prefix chosen by the resource, e.g., IAO). Note that you need to have writing permission on the OBO domain to create subdomains.

Note that if there's no /obo/$idspace.owl purl registered then the fallback is to direct to http://berkeleybop.org/ontologies/$idspace.owl, which is generated automatically by [http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Jenkins Jenkins].
