#summary HOWTO request a prefix and domain for a new resource
#labels TechnicalWG,HOWTO

= Introduction =


1. obo-discuss
2. need a contact
3. 1-2 weeks for objections
4. name not in conflict
5. no requirements for minimal review
6. work needs to be started - there has to be a public file. Should be real project.


We give the PURL but say that our expectations are at least attribution, better orthogonality

What someone should expect when we give them a purl:
You get the purl, a purl admin group, a domain (administered by you), add top level owl domain and add you as administrator
Added to ontologies.txt? Yes for now.
In future (to be dealt with when we switch to obo-registry)
Not guaranteed to be listed on OBO foundry site or any promotion
May change policies when move to obo registry.

Who makes the OBO group? Chris, Alan, Carlo, Melanie
PURL admin groups are group of users that have permissions on some PURL domains.
Existing groups are OBI, IAO, chebi,....

Naming convention for groups: obo-xxx
Need to go back and update old ones

Next step: Update wiki page with new policies.


This page describes how-to register a new prefix with the OBO Foundry and create the corresponding PURL top-domain. To register a prefix or domain:
 # the required namespace must be free
 # the resource must be publicly available
 # there must be a contact person for the resource
 # the requestor should be ready to discuss issues such as whether the ontology is orthogonal, whether there is potential to collaborate with existing efforts.

Ideally, requesters should also submit links to their project homepage/documentation, as well as a link to a tracker. 

*Template for PURL request*:
 * prefix
 * title
 * download link
 * home page
 * contact email
 * mailing-list
 * tracker link
 * PURL user ID (if PURL is requested)

Requests to be submitted at http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/issues/entry?template=Prefix/Domain%20creation

On January 9th 2013, it was decided that resources requesting a PURL in the OBO domain should satisfy a minimal set of requirements, specifics of which need to be worked on

Current proposal:
 # new ontology proposals and ID space requests go to obo-discuss
 # It is expected that solicitation of a prefix is done *before* the prefix is used for identifiers. A common strategy is to develop an ontology, request a prefix, and translate the initial URIs used to the PURLs some time before the initial release.
 # Expect a delay (at least  2 weeks) in order to give members of the community to weigh in on whether the ontology or the ID space (e.g. it conflicts with a possible future ontology, or an existing resource). In addition time is needed  to let the prefix administrators do their review. 
 # Allocation of a prefix _may_ be tied to an assessment of the perceived utility or strategy of the ontology proposed
 # one of the various committees, working groups, secretariats, etc then rules on whether the ID space is to be granted. 

Note that a formal policy has yet to be established, and the above is in flux. Edit this page to add comments or suggestions.
