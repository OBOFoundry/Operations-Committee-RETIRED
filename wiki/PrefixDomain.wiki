= Introduction =

This page describes how-to register a new prefix with the OBO Foundry and create the corresponding PURL top-domain. To register a prefix or domain:
 # the required namespace must be free
 # the resource must be publicly available
 # there must be a contact person for the resource

Ideally, requesters should also submit links to their project homepage/documentation, as well as a link to a tracker.
