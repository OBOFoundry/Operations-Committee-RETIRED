= Prefix/Domain request policy =

This page describes how-to register a new prefix with the OBO Foundry and create the corresponding PURL top-domain. To register a prefix or domain:
 # the required namespace must be free
 # the resource must be publicly available
 # there must be a contact person for the resource
 # the requestor should be ready to discuss issues such as whether the ontology is orthogonal, whether there is potential to collaborate with existing efforts.
 # new ontology proposals and ID space requests go to obo-discuss
 # It is expected that solicitation of a prefix is done *before* the prefix is used for identifiers. A common strategy is to develop an ontology, request a prefix, and translate the initial URIs used to the PURLs some time before the initial release.
 # Expect a delay (at least  2 weeks) in order to give members of the community to weigh in on whether the ontology or the ID space (e.g. it conflicts with a possible future ontology, or an existing resource).
 # no requirements for minimal review
 # work needs to be started - there has to be a public file. Should be real project.


= Prefix/Domain request process = 

*Template for PURL request*:
 * prefix
 * title
 * download link
 * home page
 * contact email
 * mailing-list
 * tracker link
 * PURL user ID (if PURL is requested)

Requests to be submitted at http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/issues/entry?template=Prefix/Domain%20creation



= Expectations = 
We give the PURL but say that our expectations are at least attribution, better orthogonality

What someone should expect when we give them a purl:
You get the purl, a purl admin group, a domain (administered by you), add top level owl domain and add you as administrator
Added to ontologies.txt? Yes for now.
In future (to be dealt with when we switch to obo-registry)
Not guaranteed to be listed on OBO foundry site or any promotion
May change policies when move to obo registry.
