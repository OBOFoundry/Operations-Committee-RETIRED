#summary HOWTO create a prefix and domain for a new resource
#labels TechnicalWG,HOWTO

= Introduction =

This page describes how-to register a new prefix with the OBO Foundry and create the corresponding PURL top-domain. To register a prefix or domain:
 # the required namespace must be free
 # the resource must be publicly available
 # there must be a contact person for the resource
 # the requestor should be ready to discuss issues such as whether the ontology is orthogonal, whether there is potential to collaborate with existing efforts.

Ideally, requesters should also submit links to their project homepage/documentation, as well as a link to a tracker. 

*Template for PURL request*:
 * prefix
 * title
 * download link
 * home page
 * contact email
 * mailing-list
 * tracker link
 * PURL user ID (if PURL is requested)

Requests to be submitted at http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/issues/entry?template=Prefix/Domain%20creation

On January 9th 2013, it was decided that resources requesting a PURL in the OBO domain should satisfy a minimal set of requirements, specifics of which need to be worked on

Current proposal:
 # new ontology proposals and ID space requests go to obo-discuss
 # It is expected that solicitation of a prefix is done *before* the prefix is used for identifiers. A common strategy is to develop an ontology, request a prefix, and translate the initial URIs used to the PURLs some time before the initial release.
 # Expect a delay (at least  2 weeks) in order to give members of the community to weigh in on whether the ontology or the ID space (e.g. it conflicts with a possible future ontology, or an existing resource). In addition time is needed  to let the prefix administrators do their review. 
 # Allocation of a prefix _may_ be tied to an assessment of the perceived utility or strategy of the ontology proposed
 # one of the various committees, working groups, secretariats, etc then rules on whether the ID space is to be granted. 

Note that a formal policy has yet to be established, and the above is in flux. Edit this page to add comments or suggestions.


= Details =

 * Add the prefix to the file ontologies.txt

The files lives at [http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/ontologies.txt http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/ontologies.txt]. Note that you will need to have sourceforge access to the OBO project at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/obo/ https://sourceforge.net/projects/obo/]

 * Add the tracker information
In the file [http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/trackers.txt http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/cgi-bin/trackers.txt]

 * Create the top-level PURL

Please check the [http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/wiki/PURLGuide PURLGuide] beforehand if you are not familiar with the PURL software/interface.

Go to [http://purl.org http://purl.org] and register the new domain as a subdomain of /obo/. Once logged in, go to the tab "Domains", option "create a new domain", and create the domain /obo/prefix (where prefix is the prefix chosen by the resource, e.g., IAO). Note that you need to have writing permission on the OBO domain to create subdomains.

Note that if there's no /obo/$idspace.owl purl registered then the fallback is to direct to http://berkeleybop.org/ontologies/$idspace.owl, which is generated automatically by [http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Jenkins Jenkins].
