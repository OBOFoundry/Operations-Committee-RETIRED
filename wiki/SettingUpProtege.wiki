#summary Setting up Protege to work with OBO ontologies

= Introduction =

This page explains how to set up Protege 4.3 to comply with the OBO Foundry [http://obofoundry.org/id-policy.shtml ID policy]

In the following, I will use the example of the Epidemiology Ontology, EPO. I will assume that you requested and obtained a PURL and prefix from the OBO Foundry administrators. Instructions to do so are available [http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/wiki/Policy_for_OBO_namespace_and_associated_PURL_requests here]

In summary, following the policy entails that:
  * your main file is available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/epo.owl (and this is your Ontology IRI)
  * you release dated versions of your file (and have a versionIRI in your file)
  * the IRIs of your terms are of the form http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/EPO_7digits
